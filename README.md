# Read-and-Write-to-a-Text-File
A script that reads a list of names from a text file, sorts the names alphabetically, and writes the sorted list to a new text file.

I have added two text files -  1. Names.txt (where somes names are written such as Fusion Tech, Jyoti, .....)
                               2. Sorted names.txt(where the alphabetically sorted names are stored from names.txt file)


Approach:

1. Write a function with file names as parameter.
2. Use simple file I/O commands for opening, reading, sorting & writing file.
3. Ask user to enter enter desired file name or path from where names are to be read and sorted.
4. Again ask the user to enter file name or path where the sorted names are to be stored.
